<p> Toledo was conquered by Roman General Marcus Fulvius Nobilior in 193 B.C.E. and became an important Roman colony, and was described by the Roman historian Livy as "urbs parva, sed loco munita" (“a small city, but fortified by location”). During the Moorish period between 712 and 1085 A.D. it became home of the Mozarab community, which is where the start of the fusion of Christian, Arab, and Jewish cultures in Toledo, the Spanish word for this phenomenon being Convivencia. One of the most famous historical mentions of Toledo is in the novel Don Quixote, as Toledo is the city and area where the title character travels through most in the historic novel. Today, Toledo exists as the city that is most representative of Spanish culture and history, and centers on the Plaza del Zocodover, pictured below. </p>
